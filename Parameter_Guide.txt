Parameter Guide

Alpha: Learning rate or step size to take in the direction of the delta

This value is generally somewhere between (0 and 1)

Auto_Alpha: automatic learning rate , instead of setting your own learning rate we learn the probability of being in the transition state and apply that
probability to our update, we don't need to worry about how fast or slow alpha decays for our agent will learn the probabilities of p(s')

Decay: This is a value generally between (0 and 1) where it describes to what extent do we want to slow down learning after each episode

Note: values > 1 will yield increasing values for ALPHA

Alpha_Min: This parameter describes how low ALPHA can be after before applying DECAY, to prevent learning getting too slow


Epsilon: how how often the agent will behave randomly (default .05) by default agent behaves randomly 5% of the time to explore the space

Entropy_Augment: Once turned on the agent's reward function is augmented with the Entropy of the transition state,

This is another exploration technique where we penalize for being too certain about actions.

We use the Entropy definition of H(x) = -p(x)log(p(x))

we define our target as

target = H(s') + r + gamma(max(Q(s',a'))

Where r is the immediate received and H(s') is the entropy of the transition state,

Note: if Entropy Augmentation is turned on Epsilon will be set to zero because they are two explorations techniques
